## Brief
Build a mobile-first carousel widget that cycles through six images via the `prev` and `next` buttons. These are styled differently depending on the viewport size.

To obtain the images please use a Pixabay account. Once they are available to the app load them into the carousel and enable the functionality for the buttons.

Feel free to use whatever tools seem most appropriate for managing styles.

Keep the carousel itself quite simple in terms of how it responds; it doesn't need to snap. Concentrate on the quality of the code.
